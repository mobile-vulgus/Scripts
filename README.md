# README - Script Projects

These are some simple command-line based scripts I've made to practice learning. 


![Comic Search](https://github.com/mobile-vulgus/Scripts/blob/master/Comic_Search/Comic_Search.png)

[Comic Search](https://github.com/mobile-vulgus/Scripts/tree/master/Comic_Search) is a Bash script I wrote to help curate reading lists for Marvel Comics fans. A user prompt collects title search terms (e.g., *X-Men* or *Avengers*) then scours a publication list that currently spans 1975-2019, printing the results into a new text file organized by date. It's still very simple, but I hope to add more nuance to this when I have time.


![Prophecy](https://github.com/mobile-vulgus/Scripts/blob/master/Prophecy_Game/Prophecy_Game.png)

[Prophecy](https://github.com/mobile-vulgus/Scripts/tree/master/Prophecy_Game) is a pseudo text-adventure game I'm working on to practice Python, though currently the code is a bit of a mess and the project is in no way finished. The basic idea is to have a traditional text adventure interface, but with much less linear, esoteric branches to follow.
